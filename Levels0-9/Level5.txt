Goal: Find the password in the file in the "inhere" directory with the following traits:
1. Is human readable
2. Is not executable
3. Is exactly 1033 bytes in size.

Solution: cd into the "inhere" directory and then use the find command like so: "find -size 1033c -readable -not -executable".  This will give the file ./maybehere07/.file2, which contains our password.
Note:  This was my first time using the find command like this, super cool!
